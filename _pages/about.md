I am currently a Marie-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Vienna, working with [Prof. Philip Walther](https://walther.univie.ac.at/). 
I received my Ph.D. in Physics from MIT LIGO in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Nergis Mavalvala](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/nergis-mavalvala/). I received my BSc from Imperial College London in 2015. 

My research interests lie in interdisciplinary research that advances quantum sensing and metrology technologies, along with their applications in quantum information processing and the exploration of fundamental questions in physics.

Feel free to reach me at haocunyu(at)mit(dot)edu!

I will be in Chicago for the [2023 Chicago Quantum Summit](https://chicagoquantum.org/events/2023-chicago-quantum-summit) and the Quantum Creator Symposium. 

* **8/3/2023** It was really fun giving a Spark talk at the Challenge Institute of Quantum Computing ([CIQC](https://ciqc.berkeley.edu/)) quantum gathering. Such a wonderful way to integrate myself in a great quantum community. <img src="/images/CIQC_site.png" alt="Addressing connectivity challenges in quantum hardware">
* **7/19/2023** It has been a pleasure attending the [QuNeW workshop](https://quantumnetworksworkshop2.splashthat.com/) where I presented preliminary results on color centers in silicon. It was really nice networking with many experts in my first quantum networking workshop/conference.

I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of quantum technology and unlocking its potential for solving complex problems in information processing and fundamental sciences. My research focuses on developing cutting-edge quantum hardware to overcome the limitations of existing solid-state quantum platforms and explore uncharted territories in physics research. Having previously introduced long-range connectivity to superconducting circuit architectures, I am now a Miller Fellow, investigating innovative telecom-band quantum emitters in the mature silicon host material. Combining my background in micro- and nano-photonic devices, I am interested in creating robust, scalable quantum processors that can simulate many-body physics and drive advancements in both practical applications and theoretical understanding.

I have been fortunate to have collaborated with outstanding mentors/colleagues from around the world, including [Oskar Painter](https://painterlab.caltech.edu/faculty/), [Soonwon Choi](https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/soonwon-choi/), [Alejandro González-Tudela](https://sites.google.com/view/gonzaleztudela), [Kerry Vahala](https://vahala.caltech.edu/people), [Yun-Feng Xiao](http://researchgroups.pku.edu.cn/microcavity/en/zdylm/12811/list/index.htm), and [Wenshan Cai](https://cailab.gatech.edu/group.html).
